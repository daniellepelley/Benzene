# Azure Mesh Self-Discovery — end-to-end example

The Azure counterpart of `examples/AwsMesh`: three Benzene Cloud Services running as **Azure Web Apps
for Containers**, plus a **mesh Web App** that discovers them **by resource tag** via Azure Resource
Manager, interrogates each over HTTPS, and serves the Mesh UI — with the catalog persisted to **Blob
Storage**.

## Architecture

```
        Azure resource group: benzene-mesh-rg
  ┌──────────┬───────────┬────────────┐
  │ orders   │ payments  │ shipping   │   3 Web Apps for Containers (one image, MESH_SERVICE selects
  │ Web App  │ Web App   │ Web App    │   the domain); each tagged  benzene = "true"
  └────┬─────┴─────┬─────┴─────┬──────┘
       │  1. list Microsoft.Web/sites (tag benzene) via Azure Resource Manager (managed identity)
       │  2. GET https://<name>.azurewebsites.net/benzene/spec|health   (interrogate)
       ▼
   ┌────────┐  writes manifest.json / services/*.json / topics.json / registry.json
   │  mesh  │  to Blob Storage; serves the Mesh UI at /mesh-ui
   └────────┘
```

- Discovery is `Benzene.Mesh.Discovery.Azure` (`AzureAppServiceDiscoveryProvider`): it lists the
  subscription's `Microsoft.Web/sites` carrying the `benzene` tag and emits **HTTP** registry entries
  at their default hostnames — so the aggregator's existing `HttpMeshServiceSource` interrogates them.
- The store is `Benzene.Mesh.Azure.Blob` (`BlobMeshArtifactStore`).
- The mesh Web App has a **system-assigned managed identity** with **Reader** on the resource group
  (to list the sites) and **Storage Blob Data Contributor** on the storage account (to read/write the
  catalog). The mesh's own Web App is **not** `benzene`-tagged, so it never discovers itself.

## Projects

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| (shared) `examples/K8sMesh/Service` | the Cloud Service image, reused as-is for the 3 Azure Web Apps |
| `Mesh/` | the Azure mesh service (Azure discovery + Blob store + UI, 30s background pass + `POST /mesh/refresh`) |
| `deploy/` | Terraform: ACR, storage + container, App Service plan, 4 Web Apps, managed identity + role assignments |
| `.github/workflows/deploy-azure-mesh-example.yml` | build+push images to ACR → `terraform apply` |

## Deploy it (GitHub Actions)

1. Put an Azure service principal in the **`test`** GitHub Environment: `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
   (the `azure/login` JSON) with rights to create the resource group, ACR, storage, App Service, and
   **to assign roles** (Owner or User Access Administrator on the subscription/RG).
2. **Actions → Deploy Azure Mesh Example → Run workflow** — supply a globally-unique ACR name and
   storage-account name. It creates the registry, builds + pushes both images, then applies the stack.
3. Grab the URLs from the final `terraform output`:
   - `mesh_ui_url` — the Mesh UI (service catalog + the cross-service **Topics** table).
   - `service_spec_ui_urls` — each service's Spec UI (with its **Benzene utilities** panel).
   - `mesh_refresh_url` — `POST` to force a discovery+aggregation pass (returns `201 {"discovered":3}`).

## OpenTelemetry

The mesh Web App wires **full OpenTelemetry** (`AddOpenTelemetry` + Benzene traces/metrics over OTLP,
plus `UseW3CTraceContext`/`UseBenzeneEnrichment`/`UseBenzeneMetrics` on the pipeline). Set
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (app setting) to export to a collector; unset, it no-ops.

### Topic usage → the Mesh UI (Application Insights)
The `UseBenzeneMetrics()` on every service (the shared `K8sMesh/Service` image) and the mesh emits the
`benzene.messages.processed` counter tagged `topic`/`transport`/`result`. When
`APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` is set (the Terraform wires it), the **Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry
exporter** also sends that counter to **Application Insights**, landing in the Log Analytics `customMetrics`
table (delta temporality → a `sum(valueSum)` over a window is the request count). The mesh then reads it
back: `AddApplicationInsightsUsage(...)` (from `Benzene.Mesh.Usage.ApplicationInsights`, wired when
`MESH_LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID` is present) queries `customMetrics` by KQL each aggregation run and writes
`usage.json` — per-topic request counts over `var.usage_window_hours` (default 24h), which the **Mesh UI**
renders (Usage column + by-transport / by-status). Terraform adds a Log Analytics workspace + Application
Insights and grants the mesh identity **Log Analytics Reader**. Coarse counts by design — fine detail stays
in App Insights/Grafana. (Per-service attribution and duration are documented follow-ups — the counter
isn't tagged by service, which the UI surfaces honestly as an absent dimension.)

## Discovery scope

Discovery is pinned to this deployment's subscription and resource group via two app settings on the
mesh Web App (`MESH_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `MESH_RESOURCE_GROUP`, both set by Terraform). This keeps the
sweep constrained even if the mesh identity is later granted `Reader` at subscription scope — without
them, `DefaultAzureCredential`'s *default* subscription is used and the sweep spans every
benzene-tagged site the identity can see. `MESH_REGION` narrows further by region.

## Discovering Azure Functions

The example hosts the three services as **Web Apps for Containers**, but discovery is hosting-model
agnostic: a Function App is a `Microsoft.Web/sites` resource, so a benzene-tagged Function App is
discovered exactly like a Web App. To make one *interrogable* it must expose the Cloud Service Profile
endpoints the aggregator fetches — `/benzene/spec` and `/benzene/health` — over HTTP, which means:
(1) HTTP-triggered `/benzene/*` endpoints via `Benzene.Azure.Function.*`; (2) either an empty
`routePrefix` in `host.json` or the `benzene:spec-path`/`benzene:health-path` resource tags pointed at
`/api/benzene/...`; and (3) `authLevel: anonymous` on those two triggers (the aggregator carries no
function key). A Consumption-plan Function may cold-start past the aggregator's 10s fetch timeout and
flash *Unreachable* until warm.

## Known first-deploy iteration points

Like the AWS example, the live Azure behaviour is only verifiable on a real deploy; the likely
first-run tweaks (all localized):
- **.NET 10 base images** — the Dockerfiles use `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/{sdk,aspnet}:10.0`; pin to
  the exact tag your registry has if `10.0` doesn't resolve.
- **Web App container port** — set via `WEBSITES_PORT=8080` (the container listens on `PORT=8080`);
  if a site returns 502 on cold start this is the first thing to check.
- **Role-assignment propagation** — a `time_sleep` gives the mesh identity's principal time to
  propagate before its Reader/Blob role assignments apply (removing the first-apply `PrincipalNotFound`
  race). The roles themselves can still take a minute to take *effect*, so an early discovery pass may
  return `0` until they propagate (the background pass retries).
- **Managed-identity blob auth** — `DefaultAzureCredential` uses the Web App's managed identity in
  Azure; ensure the identity has **Storage Blob Data Contributor**, not just control-plane access (a
  missing data-plane role surfaces as a 403 on the first blob write).
